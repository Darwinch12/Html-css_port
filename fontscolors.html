    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Choosing the right font is hugely important. A font supports the message 
you want to deliver to the reader in 2 ways. On the one hand, a smoothly 
readable font is necessary to let the content of your site affect the 
surfer properly. On the other hand, the chosen font accentuates who your 
    site's target audience is.</p>
<p>For a broad target audience, always choose sans serif fonts. These can be 
    common sans serif fonts such as Arial or Verdana, but thanks to <a class="blink" href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google 
    Fonts</a> there is a much larger selection of sans serif webfonts with which 
    you can make the difference.</p>
<p>On a site you use no more than 2 different fonts. For the majority of 
texts you choose a sans serif font that is easy to read. Only for the 
titles you can consider choosing a slightly more artistic font, possibly 
even a font with serifs or a font that looks handwritten. This is often 
    done on sites where luxury goods are offered.</p>

    <p id="Elegance">There are many clean and elegant Google fonts available for us to choose from. Does it feel overwhelming to scroll through Google’s list of fonts? While it’s great to have such a wide selection, choosing the right fonts can take some time.</p>
    <p id="Elegance">The fonts you select should be easy-to-read, match your brand style, and provide an aesthetically pleasing experience for site visitors.(text extract by <a class="blink" href="https://natsuminishizumi.com/blog/clean-and-elegant-google-fonts">Natsumi Nishizumi</a>)</p>

    <h3 id="Hiphead">Hip</h3>
    <p id="Hip">A hipster is a person who stays updated with the latest trends; someone who is hip. Yet another definition for hipster means having a retro or a throwback vibe. Quite confusing, to be honest, but in graphic design and typography, being “hipster” may mean having a unique and somewhat vintage look without being outdated.(text extract by <a class="alink" href="https://inspirationfeed.com/free-hipster-fonts/">InspirationFeed</a>)</p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Choosing the right color scheme is necessary to support the "call to 
action" of the website. A website for the general public should have 
neutral colors, rather dull, but acceptable to everyone worldwide - 
    regardless of origin, language or culture.</p>
<p>Those who want to emphasize that everything on the site is cheap opt for 
accents in bright red, bright yellow and/or bright blue. These colors 
    stimulate our brain and motivate impulse purchases.</p>
<p>If you want to emphasize timeless elegance and convince (older, richer) 
customers to opt for luxury products with a higher price tag, it's best to 
    use subtle shades of gray.</p>
<p>If you want to appeal to a young audience in particular, you have to find 
a connection with the world of that audience. For children it can be very 
colorful, for teenagers (and hipsters) a negative design with a black 
    background.</p>
<p>Choosing colors is an art in itself, you have to learn which colors go 
together. 1 golden tip: colors that occur together in nature, always 
match. That's why color schemes are often made based on a photo. Thanks to 
the photo, the client immediately sees what atmosphere the colors evoke. 
You do not need special software or a camera for this. Adobe will help you 
    for free at <a class="blink" href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel">color.adobe.com.</a></p>

  <h3 id="Neutral">Neutral</h3>
  <p>Neutral usually means without color, but these hues sometimes have faint undertones of blue, gold, peach, pink, tan and yellow.</p>
  <p>Neutral colors do not show up on the color wheel. People in fashion, decorating and other professions that use colors prominently refer to neutral colors as earth tones. These colors have a flexibility and visual balance that works in a number of settings. They also have a classic, subtle feel in rooms, clothing and furniture that also make use of bolder and more vibrant colors in their designs.(text extract by <a class="alink" href="https://www.reference.com/world-view/neutral-color-db4481f827bf5a1c">Reference</a>)</p>
