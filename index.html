    <h2> About me </h2>
    <p>My name is Lucas, a first year student at Est√°cio born in Brazil.</p>
    <p> Had started at a young age, I have been traveling a lot and learning all sorts of things from each and every place I have lived in and so I could develop a better understanding about people and reciprocal relations, which I believe is an essential trait in today's society. </p>
    <p> I look to keep improving this trait by learning new artistic skills such as drawing and playing musical instruments so I can also develop my creativity, thus, becoming sensible to new ideas. </p>
    <p> My main Objective for this year is to fully understand every subject in this Software engineering course in order to create decent projects of which could lead me to a promising future in the IT market.</p>
